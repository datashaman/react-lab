React Quickie
=============

Boilerplate using:

* react - https://facebook.github.io/react/
* omniscient - http://omniscientjs.github.io/
* immstruct - https://github.com/omniscientjs/immstruct
* webpack - http://webpack.github.io/
* babel-loader - https://github.com/babel/babel-loader

Make tasks:

* serve - serving from public using webpack-dev-server with hot replacement (default)
* build - pack entry points into build folder

Folders:

* build - webpack builds
* public - static assets and container index.html
* src - all your source goes in here. Use .jsx files to use babel. Add more loaders as appropriate.
